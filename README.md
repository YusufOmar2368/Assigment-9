The purpose of this program is to create a single summarized record for each player in the combine dataset by combining all of that player’s rows across years. It turns row-level combine data into player-level season history and basic average measurements.
The program takes an input CSV (combine data) and scans every row, grouping entries by player name (preferring nameFull, otherwise nameFirst + nameLast) while collecting seasons played, positions, colleges, and height/weight values. It outputs a new CSV with one row per player including first/last year, a sorted list of seasons, season count, combined positions/colleges, and average height/weight.
The main function build_player_summaries reads the file using csv.DictReader, uses header-based heuristics to locate year/position/college/height/weight fields, then stores aggregated data in a dictionary where each player key maps to sets (for unique seasons/positions/colleges) and lists (for numeric height/weight values). After processing, it writes the summary with csv.DictWriter, computing min/max for year range, len(seasons) for the season count, joining sets with semicolons, and calculating averages from the numeric lists before printing a confirmation message.
